# Custom Chatbot Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for developing a **Custom Chatbot**. The chatbot is designed to provide personalized responses based on user inputs and can be customized for a wide range of applications, including customer service, information retrieval, and conversational agents.

## Overview

The Custom Chatbot project demonstrates how to build a chatbot using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and the implementation of the chatbot to handle specific user queries. The chatbot can be fine-tuned for different industries and use cases.

### Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes NLP techniques to understand and process user queries.
- **Custom Responses**: Allows customization of responses based on the chatbot’s intended use.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements a machine learning model to improve response accuracy and adaptability over time.

## Files in the Repository

- **Custom_Chatbot.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for building, training, and deploying the custom chatbot.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-link>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install the required libraries for running the notebook:
   ```bash
   pip install -r <libraries used in notebook>
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to build and test the chatbot:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Custom_Chatbot.ipynb
   ```

4. **Customize the Chatbot**: Modify the chatbot’s training data and response logic to suit your specific application needs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
